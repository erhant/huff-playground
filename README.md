# Huff Playground

Huff is a low-level programming language designed for developing highly optimized smart contracts that run on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). Huff does not hide the inner workings of the EVM and instead exposes its programming stack to the developer for manual manipulation.

This repository is a playground for Huff. See [Huff by Example](https://docs.huff.sh/get-started/huff-by-example/#introduction) for detailed examples.
